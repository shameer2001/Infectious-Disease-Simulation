# Infectious-Disease-Simulation

Computation is crucial in order to simulate an infectious disease. This reports outlines a very basic simulation which should not be used to guide action in the event of a spread. However, such simulations provides the foundation for ones that are used to save lives. This simulation accurately modelled the infection of a singular person with a less accurate modelling of spread amongst a population with the leading cause being the inability to code the recovery of multiple infected individuals simultaneously.

The simulation could be much improved. Recovery time could be varied, simulating the differential in immune response amongst a population. Also, a death rate could be coded which can be varied to match the level of compromised individuals in a populations (e.g. elderly people, comorbidity etc.). However, the biggest problem with the population simulation is the inability to code recovery time without having the infected individuals recover one at a time. This could potentially be fixed in the future, however, it was not done in this project due to time constraints. Thus, a short recovery time was chosen (2 days) to prevent instant recovery. A longer recovery time was avoided since it is much less accurate as the recovery for other infected individuals would be further delayed.
